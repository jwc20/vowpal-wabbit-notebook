0 | Chat Coronavirus is the one and only reason Trump lost 2020 at all, and even then he very barely lost. Like, lost Georgia and Arizona by only 10k votes level of slim margins. OF COURSE he'll win 2024 if he's still alive. Because the Democrats don't have a fucking plan at all.
0 | Chat Bjergsen moving to C9 Academy for sure. Darshan is too enticing to not play with, who could blame him.
0 | Chat That is the push of a player who's got shit to do. One way or another that game was ending, whoever wins is irrelevant.
0 | Chat Only 364 days to go!
0 | Chat I only saw a couple of these throughout the month and tried to figure out what all of them were. Only ones I missed were Star Guardian Seraphine (thought it was Heartbreaker) and I couldn't figure out the 2nd Soraka was Victorious. So all in all, you did a really good job nailing the characters and the theme presented! I think my faves are KDA Neeko and CCN Xayah.
0 | Chat The R-7A was operational as an ICBM in early ‚Äò59 about 6 months before the US Atlas. However as you pointed out, the Soviets had far fewer of them (about 10) and they were hardly responsive (taking a day to prepare for launch). The Atlas was better (but not by much)
0 | Chat If this is a serious question, it‚Äôs the week long break in November that was implemented for student mental health
0 | Chat Yes. The first 4 seasons of the show are very good. But starting with 5 starts to go down hill compared to the books. Also the shows character compression changes some arcs dramatically. Because they squish 3-5 characters into one.
0 | Chat You have eagle eyes, friend! Keep 'em coming!
0 | Chat How I look before crossing the street
0 | Chat If you ever visit New Orleans/south Louisiana or South Mississippi you‚Äôll greatly appreciate their snowballs. I grew up with options like nectar stuffed with soft serve or tigersblood topped with condensed milk, or half coffee half almond with evaporated milk on top.

0 | Chat For those that don't know, a Tim-Tam is a rectangular shaped chocolate coated biscuit. If you bite off opposing corners, you can use it as a straw to drink tea or coffee. The hot drink melts the inside and you can slurp it up as a "Tim-Tam Slam".

0 | Chat He actually drew the entire storyboard. He later drew the storyboard for TRON too. Definitely watch the documentary Jodorowski's Dune. Besides being a hilarious story it contains a lot of artwork Moebius did for the film that you cannot find elsewhere. Unfortunately the complete Dune production bible still hasn't been released to this date.

0 | Chat Discovered this the hard way this weekend. I'd been goinggoinggoing for like a month and of course had a lot of plans for being productive this weekend and getting things done around the house. My body and brain said NOPE and I spent all of Saturday lying on the couch watching TV and then went to the movies and hung out with friends on Sunday. The house is now a wreck and I'm back at work for the next five days but hopefully I got some recharging done.

0 | Chat Just finished the survey! Zyra also seems to be missing from the champion list.
0 | Chat So super cute! üñ§
0 | Chat You know how when you see a puppy you get all excited and start acting like a goof to show it you are their fren? Do that same thing to people. People are not as highly perceptive as we think we are. We will go with a lot of nonsense for the sake of the group. It's biology! So just be yourself, say what you think out loud but say the kind things a little extra loud and animated. ;)
0 | Chat The detail on those mountains is incredible!
0 | Chat Your Sorakas are so beautiful. I especially love pool party amumu and hextech yuumi~

0 | Chat That would be a pretty good timeline for NA
0 | Chat Get a fruity hot sauce and put it on a peanut butter sandwich. It‚Äôs amazing.
0 | Chat I am inclined to agree with these sentiments. In addition, not only do I expect to see inaction from governments, but paradoxically I expect to see a further amplification of capitalism from the masses, left and right. And for me, the exiting of this decade looks a bleak one.

0 | Chat I hope the liner is Pillow Talk. It‚Äôs so basic but I love that shade so much.
0 | Chat imagine if they'd done it last year - the reports were they'd be have Upset/Hyli bot... absolute wet dream. Kinda like how in 2019 G2 signed most of my favourite players it's hard not to support all those players together. Interesting that the rumours were it fell apart as Alphari was unhappy with jungle situation (Vitality wanting to play Skeanz and not sign Trick) and now Selfmade's there and he's interested in joining again.
0 | Chat I‚Äôm 70 and I agree.
0 | Chat Can‚Äôt wait to see your session!!
0 | Chat Funnily enough I was looking online last week and wondering why nobody has opened an eSports/Gaming bar round here. Can‚Äôt wait to pop in at some point :)
0 | Chat I have never killed a bird nor shot a rabbit. I never liked fishing and always let others kill even the chickens which I ate. Nearly all my schoolmates in the South carried pistols. I never owned one. I could never conceive myself killing a human being. But in 1906 I rushed back from Alabama to Atlanta where my wife and six-year old child were living. A mob had raged for days killing Negroes. I bought a Winchester double-barreled shotgun and two dozen rounds of shells filled with buckshot. If a white mob had stepped on the campus where I lived I would without hesitation have sprayed their guts over the grass.‚Äù
0 | Chat Its better to say, that its not surv or hunter sided. As someone in this post said, every hunter as every survivor have a good skills. Depends on the player? Of course. Both sides rant about this kind of conversation, so both sides need to swallow the same kind of pill, "ts not surv or hunter sided"
0 | Chat You may not always be abled to see it yourself, but someone else might. Found that out today... while dressed as a vampire, funnily enough... I pretty much always look like a vampire though so idk if that counts.

0 | Chat This is an amazing story. Thank you for sharing.
0 | Chat If you build ap with lethal tempo on him you can get absolutely ridiculous shred-through-anything attack speed. Like turrets won't even last half a second when he's beating the shit out of them. It's one of my favourite build in the game because of how ridiculous his damage output is and how hilarious he looks while doing it. I've got a few clips of it, i might post one if ppl want to see it lol.
0 | Chat I just reread this part of Crystal Shard, too. Salvatore didn't say anything about it, but I'd imagined his purple eyes shining or twinkling (heh) when he found it. I love the image.
0 | Chat I heard Doinb is looking for a team. Let's get that mid team going.
0 | Chat This is true for a lot of people, and it isn‚Äôt out of the realm of possibility

0 | Chat One of the very few bioavailable sources of vitamin D you can get from diet, IIRC
0 | Chat Except for the cipher decoding speed which is fast as f, I agree. At the start of the game, people were getting destroyed by Geisha and now she eats more pallets than ever.
0 | Chat The camera malfunction got me too, I had to go back and watch the last few minutes. I was expecting some camera weirdness like the distortion, but it just stopped cycling to the corridor. That was pretty good. Thanks for the recommendation as well!

0 | Chat Can I ask how? Sorry from UK and never heard of this
0 | Chat I feel like this is the way she used to be played and yet she hasn't been that good since season 4. She needs more utility to see competitive play.
0 | Chat Same exact word! Spanish speakers just like to add -ita or -ito to the end of things to make it sound cute. It's also use when referring to something small- like grandmas! :D
0 | Chat Well I think the dog owner found his doggos new favorite experience.
0 | Chat I wanna see both of those so badly! Has CSC confirmed Assassins is still happening at some point?
0 | Chat Is it apple sauce on the bottom with the h/h poured over the top? Or the whole thing stirred together?
0 | Chat Checks out. I am that person. I'm barely 5'2'' in a friend group of 6ft+ giants. Dang it, they're going to be happy giants if I can help it!!
0 | Chat And there's nothing wrong with that! I still have my IRL halloween stuff up and it will probably stay up until obscenely close to IRL turkey day because I too am lazy
0 | Chat That was also my favourite part to edit / what originally inspired me to make the video... the music video scene was just so perfect.
0 | Chat As Elise if you use Spider form E on an enemy your spider form passive‚Äôs auto dmg and healing is increased by 40%. Edit: Actually its 40/50/70/85/100% apparently. Just checked the league wiki lmao.

0 | Chat Is this the first full video that Carla has done for Food52?
0 | Chat Vito wouldn't have orchestrated his scheme if he felt that he still had long for this world. Perhaps, the war will continue as a personal vendetta on part of the Corleone Family which will likewise all but ensure their demise, which is ironic considering that the Maranzano was wiped in the same manner: a failed deal that spiraled down.
0 | Chat That‚Äôs pretty much exactly what happened to me
0 | Chat I just kind of pour a bit on top of the applesauce in a bowl. Like, if I had a little saucer of applesauce at a restaurant, I'd use three of those little half-and-half sealed cups. It's good both eaten "separately" (like cereal style) or mixed. I just kinda do what I feel like doing with it at the time.

0 | Chat Damn it feels great to see a good Bulls team
0 | Chat tbf, i think that a good change in play-ins would only be possible if the whole group stage gets reformated as well, the 2017 changes for play-ins basically killed any hope of a minor region improving if they aren't based near china/korea
0 | Chat The transition from pointless angry noise to music about real social ills will do that to you Not that metal can't be good music but I don't remember the last time I heard a meaningful protest song come out of anyone I'd ever heard of.

0 | Chat Hey! I'm applying for the second time, last year I got into AEON, but was not granted an interview for JET. Right now I am waiting to go to Japan with AEON, but because the Japanese borders are still closed, I figured I would reapply for JET in the meantime. I have my SoP from last year, and I'm wondering if thats the reason I was not granted an interview last time. Would anyone be willing to look mine over?

0 | Chat I really do miss Tom nook doing the daily announcements I wish him and Isabelle would switch off on occasion and really mix it up
0 | Chat I don't know man, I think it's fine they are there as gatekeepers. LJL got out of groups first time in history, and they got destroyed in groups. Imagine if no major regions were there to gatekeep, groups would be embarrassing. On another note, remember that MAD didn't even made it past play-ins last year, so there is potential for upsets.
0 | Chat I'm excited for ipsy GBX too, it's my first ever gbx, and i hadn't gotten ipsy in more than a year so i do hope I'm not massively disappointed
0 | Chat Bro 5$ was a lot to me when I was 12
0 | Chat I think it‚Äôs just a bit weird to have her there sitting awkwardly in the background and occasionally chiming in. Why not just bring her on the couch if she‚Äôs going to be in the recording room watching anyways?
0 | Chat I feel they should have gone with bone ankles instead of white socks for death.

0 | Chat I do this with store-bought breaded shrimp all the time. The way you are better than be is that the seasoning is IN the batter, not dusted on top. Play! Experiment! You'll do something wonderful if you are already putting in that effort.
0 | Chat I liked Juno a lot! I used in the summer instead of moisturizer at night and my skin was always perfectly hydrated and felt brighter. I have combo skin too but it‚Äôs the perfect warm weather oil

0 | Chat Yes! Love the toothsome feel of the bones. Plus calcium.
0 | Chat The book is a lot clearer that the father-son succession is not automatic, and that Michael's going to have to be successful to solidify his position. As to why the Corleones can't just cash out and walk away, I don't know. The plan seems to be that they'll cross the line to legitimacy when they're rich enough to be powerful based on money alone. It could just be that they never see themselves as having that much money.
0 | Chat I'm still really confused why A-1 has decided to go from floor 1 to floor 5 with their Progressive adaptation. I absolutely love floor 5 (volume 4) of Progressive, but floors 2-4 getting the cut isn't a smart adaptation decision. EDIT: So Kawahara has confirmed on his Twitter that the reason floors 2-4 are being skipped is because the Elf War Campaign is still incomplete, and don't want viewers to be unsatisfied with the questline.
0 | Chat He is adorable! I'm so glad you got him back, OP! What a sweet fella.
0 | Chat It was actually KiWiKiD, but I can see how you'd mistype it. Letters are close together and whatnot

0 | Chat My parents were just there, they told me just 3 days ago. Wild.
0 | Chat The dragon bonus damage is actually massive, sadly it basically never makes a difference. Her passive is still shit. But don't underestimate the damage, you take drakes faster than any other champ in the game and in steal situations it can come in clutch when your AP E might deal 1200 damage to a drake over the wall. And if AD, your EQ-smite is also like 2k damage.
0 | Chat That's one of the things that I'm really proud of punx for. Never gave up the tradition of NeoNazi bashing.
0 | Chat i understand you love to draw female champs but not seeing sett skin really made me sad :/

0 | Chat I never understood this. Like, did they edit stuff out or dude just absolutely crack under the pressure or was he just there to do that only? Like, what was that? Other than the best moment in HK history.
0 | Chat Any scene with the Baron. My favourite character by far!
0 | Chat there are literally zero 'credentials' other than who you are, and how willing you are to be involved. If you focus too much on the technical stuff, you will miss the point.

0 | Chat You should also know choosing your degree is not nearly as big of a deal as people make it out to be and the most important thing you will do in college is demonstrate your ability and drive to learn new skills. The ability to conduct research and apply critical thinking will far out way anything else you learn in school when you actually start your career. Don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously when you‚Äôre 18 years old.

0 | Chat Of course! I'm actually glad you asked, was pretty ticked off seeing my comment being downvoted with no reason and no one arguing why; anyways here I go. People often cite titanic hydra as a must buy for shyvana, but I argue it's only a good item situationally, and a pretty late buy. The reasons for that is that while we call "AD Shyvana" "AD", it should really be "Attack speed shyvana", as most of her damage comes from her E passive. Titanic Hydra costs 3.3k gold while providing no attack speed, this already means that you can't buy it until your 3rd item (which is already pretty late). The stats are pretty nice, HP is really good on shyvana since she has high base resistances on top of her passive. However, as I mentioned previously, AD is nice but doesn't do a whole lot for her (which is why PtA is better 95% of the time over Conq). A good reason to buy titanic hydra would be for wave/jungle clear, but with W maxed out you already melt waves and jungle camps. The on-hit is nice on paper, but often feels lackluster in practice. In my opinion, if you want survivability you should get Athanema's, steraks or a tank item. Hell, I might even Black Cleaver higher just because of the movespeed. I'd rate Demonic Embrace even higher than titanic if it gave a little less AP and more HP. Now I haven't tested the item (titanic) a lot, I tried it maybe a dozen times and every time it felt lackluster for a 3.3k item so I kinda discarded it. I might need to try it again to make myself a more recent opinion. tl;dr: 3.3k item so high expectations, HP is very nice on shyvana but AD is whatever. On-hit effect nice on paper but negligible when comparing to other options (notably botrk and wit's end). Cleave passive borderline useless. I'd only get this item as a 3rd+ item but at that point I feel like there are better options depending on what you built previously.

0 | Chat Ad shyvanna is basically a worse Udyr, not Jax I think. Jax's leap is reliable engage, whereas without ult Shyv's game plan is to run at them.

0 | Chat You should read The Incal if you haven't. It's illustrated by Moebius and written by the guy who was gonna direct that Dune movie that never came, they used many ideas they planned for their adaption for The Incal. Also check out Jodorowsky's Dune if you haven't too. It's a documentary covering the production of the movie, it's a wild story. The team they put together for it went on to influence so much of modern sci-fi

0 | Chat Something experience-based you can both do together might be better than something material. For example, take them to some sporting event or concert and go all out for the night with box seats, dinner, etc. After my business was purchased, I ended up doing more trips that I would cover tickets and hotel for friends if they got themselves there. To me at least it feels less transactional and more balanced in the relationship than buying someone a car or throwing money at gifts. YMMV!

Crack an egg into it right before the noodles are done cooking, or, if you're really hungry, melt a slice of American cheese into the noodles and mix it up really well. Also, and this applies to all instant noodles, don't use the amount of water they recommend on the bag. Use less, fill your pot up just enough to submerge the noodle puck. And don't drink all the broth, that's a lot of salt.

0 | Chat I was pretty intimidated by this too when I started thinking about applying. My job history was only at one retail location for over 10 years where I worked myself up to a manager role. It actually wasn't until a JET alumni told me how I could use all my managerial skills in the classroom that I stopped being intimidated by all the "I have however much teaching experience" comments. I fully agree with Fallen189; mostly everyone applying is right out of college and haven't really had any real world experience. I suggest looking at what volunteering opportunities are available in your area. I did an online book reading event with first graders through my county. It wasn't brought up in the interview at all lol but they did ask why I want to switch careers after having worked my way up, so keep that in mind too if you land an interview! Good luck!

0 | Chat That is amazing. Many men are pressured too fight to save face, even taking care of your own children can be seen as femenine. It's amazing that more men get help instead of having to just swallow their problems and end expressing that frustration with violence that makes them and the people around then unhappy out even unsafe.

0 | Chat Lookin like yhorm from dark souls. Neato
0 | Chat Yep. I agree. It really is one of the best things I've experienced in any medium. I'm glad you were able to put into words what you feel about House in Fata Morgana, I love almost everything about it and I couldn't put it into words the way you did. I'll copy what I wrote a year ago "If I had to best describe The House in Fata Morgana, it's a story about stories. I empathized with the characters, all flawed yet beautiful people with their own stories to tell. It's a story of love and curses that span almost a thousand years and is beautiful every step of the way.". It's been almost a year since I've read House in Fata Morgana, and while the strength of my emotions after having read it subsided after a few weeks. I still look back to the art and especially certain songs and feel a certain kind of melancholy to have finished such a great read, but will probably never forget it enough to be able to read it again blind. As a side note: will you be reading requiem?
0 | Chat Post was funny, but this took it to another level.

0 | Chat In the real world it did not go well when Carlo Gambino picked brother in law Paul Castellano as successor. Many of the capos and soldiers thought underboss Neil Dellacroce had earned the job. One of those capos was a fellow named Gotti, and we all know what happened at Sparks Steakhouse. Ironically, after he went to prison John then tried to turn what power was left over to brother Peter Gotti and son John Jr., but by that point it barely mattered - John died in prison and underboss Sammy Gravano had turned rat, so there was not much of a Gambino Family left.

1 | Chat Yep, That's our Obama! Can't believe Anyone ever voted for this Soulless B*$trd. Who thought that voting for the child of an African was qualified to be President of the United States of America? We were taught in school & college years after Obama was born that in order to run for President of the United States of America you must be born of Two United States Citizens. This was Specifically so that someone did not come along with Dreams Of Their Father's homeland. Somehow in that first brief year he was put into the U.S. Senate, that changed and the Democrats said nothing and the Republicans looked the other way because he had black skin. You were racest if you said anything bad about the son of an African Marxist, the son of an American Marxist, the Grandson of African Marxists and grandson of American Communists and the devoted admirer of "Frank Marshall Davis" who he wanted to.emulate. Those were Barrack Obamas Qualifications, but Obama wore the almighty cloak of blackness.

1 | Chat F Ted. Use him for what he is good for - which may be considerable. But in the end not enough. Where does he stand on forced vaccination? Where does he stand on Jan 6th ? He imagined he would be the next President. If he could just get rid of trump. He had an entire speech already prepared Jan 6th condemning over 100,000 VOTERS in PEACEFUL PROTEST. All prepared. While hiding under his desk and trembling in fear? Give me a break. While he would be far better than biden he is basically a POS. His constituents lost electricity and had no heat. So he went to a warm island with his fam - the only people who really mattered - and invited his neighbors for entertainment. I don't think they even went. Why should we? Watch this guy closely. He is good ay a lot but definitely inferior than the average hoe. We deserve better

1 | Chat the boy says black on white hate crimes. lol. little boy, play time has been over. your people own the patent on hate crime and terrorism. there is no fake numbers or pseudoscience that can hide that truth. the only ones who can't see it are deliberate or unfortunate fools like yourself. no matter how many times you repeat the lie, it will still be a lie and the world knows it. it's in everybody's history and current world events. you're only fooling yourselves and your poor pups who haven't learned that you can't be trusted yet. we learn who you are at a very young age. your people teach us lies when the truth is obvious so you're not even good liars. lol. the truth is not hidden. it's written by many hands of many nations and people including yours. now it's time for you to catch up. stop holding on to your childish fairytales of imagined superiority and innocence. you were always the savages. you pointed your fingers at others who taught you and educated you while every great thing you claimed was stolen from those you looked down on. you only destroy and kill and the world will always be shit as long as you have any control over it. anyone with eyes can see that truth. war, pollution, and corruption all fall at your feet and the day is coming in which you will be judged. you will pay the price for your actions. funny thing is you set the level of your own punishment by the way you have treated those you hate. you are showing the world how to purge itself of your doings. you say peace but you only recognize bloodshed and war. well you're outnumbered by millions and you're exposing yourselves as the unapologetic enemy to all people who want peace and prosperity in the world. keep it up. i love it! the more you talk, the closer it gets. say something hateful and racist now so it can be even more obvious. let's speed up the process. lol

Its almost as if you are a liberal, posting to stoke and fertilize hatred of the Republican party. I take solice in the knowledge that your kind will be dead soon enough, and hopefully the country won't have turned into a socialist latino cess pool by then. Only then can true patriots, that care about their country and not mythology, correct the damage done by the ignorant and lazy masses.

I only pray Allen West is honest but Congress is a circular firing squad because nobody and I mean nobody is above being weeded out and blackmailed for past slimy deeds. Sooooo‚Ä¶Congress pretends to get angry at one another and threaten and bark with indignation, yet nothing. Nada. Zilch folks, because they are all complicit! There will be no Contempt of Congress brought forward against the I.R.S.. There will be no firing or arrest of Eric Holder. Obama is still slicker than Teflon¬Æ because he is not our President. Other people run the country. Think Valerie Jarrett (monster Muslim), Bilderberg. The U.N., Massive corporations that Teddy Roosevelt got rid of way back in the day yet, they came to life again like the ‚Äúcreepin‚Äô crud.‚Äù And of course Wall Street and the World Banks. In essence ladies and gentlemen we are Royally Gacked which means the inevitable will happen as T. Jefferson said. We will reset this mess with a full blown, good ole‚Äô fashioned 21st Century Civil War. Or of course we can all go sit in a FEMA camp whining about the food and missing The Facebook. We suck and blow if we let Congress drag this garbage out even one more day! Can you tell I‚Äôm ticked yet? By the way, anything less than arresting and prosecuting Obama will not work. Impeachment will die in the Marxist controlled Senate. Recall Bill Clinton? Wrist slap and a pat on the back!!! Graphitorically speaking‚Ä¶

But how deep and wide is her gap? Is it same as her mouth size? The photo did not tell. In Chinese old saying: mouth size is same as gap size. That said means if she doesn't have a big mouth, the gap between rich and poor is not that big. And If Tax the Rich can help America, then Shag the Bitch can save America. So Tax the Rich; Shag the Bitch.

1 | Chat Nitwit Biden and AOC, dumb and dummer, are trying to give $450,000 of our taxdollars to each and every illegal immigrant. If they pass this through, it will destroy America as we know it. The world Economic Forum , which is One World Government has this slogan on their website , Build Back Better. Wake up America!!! End time Bible prophecy is here. The New World Order can‚Äôt take over until they destroy America. The Clintons, Obama‚Äôs, the Bush family, Pelosi, George Soros, Bill Gates, Nitwit Biden, the Pope, all are members of the Illuminati and the One World Government. Have you noticed that many stores have signs up that there is a coin shortage? Destroying our dollar and economy, destroying our military, and taking our guns and closing CHRISTIAN churches, is how they accomplish this horrible plan. The end times will have one world religion, one world government, one world currency, taking over all our rights and we will be ruled by the communist elites. Socialism is a lie. Look at Venezuela. Socialism is the stepping stone to Communism. Please pray and vote and fight the good fight of faith. Take our country back. Jesus is coming soon for his church. Don‚Äôt be left behind. Those continually Living in sin won‚Äôt enter heaven and if the church you attend teaches a greasy gospel of sin permission grace. Run for you life! The Bible is very plain, it‚Äôs not just believing in Jesus. The demons believe and they tremble. Accepting Jesus is not just a saying a prayer. It‚Äôs a lifestyle change. Jesus said those who love me Obey me, and keep my commandments . Yes, there is grace and mercy for all that truly repent, which means to stop continually sinning and live for Jesus. Knowing and obeying the truth sets you free!

Speaking of Chik Fil A, we're buying all those and giving them to any LGBTQ person your sick cult leaders tortured with conversion therapy. Have fun with the new menu you bigoted fucks. Try the McPence. It's a boiled unseasoned chicken breast that you have to eat in the closet with your mother. We‚Äôre going to gather up ALL of your guns, melt them down and turn them into a gargantuan metal mountain emblazoned with the face of Hillary Clinton. ALL parks will be renamed Rosa Parks asap. We're replacing Confederate statues with BLM Leaders & Mexican immigrants. Every single public school will be renamed after a child that was kidnapped by this regime. And after we fumigate the WH, we're repainting the whole thing rainbow. Fox News will be taken over and turned into a family refugee shelter. We're turning Hannity's office into a giant unisex bathroom with changing tables & free tampons. And every single time a Trumpster complains about any of the changes, we're adding an openly gay character to a Disney movie."

1 | Chat Now we all know this is just another fantasy with hopeful thinking.... Biden is desperate to be pardoned from his sins but does he not know that the pope does not save a man only Jesus can do this!! This demented Biden has condoned the greatest atrocity of all time by allowing the murdering of innocent unborn babies. He has also left young men behind enemy lines to die with only a selfish motivations. He has also condemned innocent men, women and children to lives of poverty due to the unrelentless lies of this COVID-19 fiasco, taking livelihoods, health loss and death due to unverified and quickly released vaccines that do only harm and provide no solutions to the virus itself. This man was placed in a position to care for a nation of people and he has failed in every avenue intentionally because he has a personal agenda to single-handedly wreck this nation in order to bring on a socialist regime. He has gone against God‚Äôs people and it‚Äôs persecuting them relentlessly which eventually will perpetuate and extend out into the world. If this pope is lying to the president about the way he is handling his affairs as a president then God help that pope as well because he is a liar. ÔøºÔøºÔøº

Furthermore, I was approached by Gay Men/Pedophiles to make Gay/Pedophile Porn while still age 14, 15, 16 and 17. I am glad that you, Weinstein and the rest of you pieces of SHIT are being revealed for who you really are - this is the Hollywood of today. While it took me 20 to 35 years to reveal these facts, I am glad that I can share this with the General Public; I am relieved. People like you deserve to be castrated in Public...
